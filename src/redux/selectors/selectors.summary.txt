You can think of a selector as a read-only query to a database. Because selectors can’t change the
state, they won’t damage your single source of truth.
It is a good practice to create as many selectors as needed to produce optimized data structures for
view rendering, and keep the UI components stateless and clean. If you are doing heavy calculations
or transforming large data structures, use memoized selectors for performance.
